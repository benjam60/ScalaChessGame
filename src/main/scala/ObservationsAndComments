TODO:
1. If a player wants to move, make sure that the move doesn't put them in check
2. Add typesafety to the board class
3. Had a bug where I mixed up player info based on color--use type safety to fix it
4. Pull out gameplay stuff

How do you structure the code to prevent shotgun surgery?

How do you structure the code to allow plugins? E.g. track the number of pieces
or replay certain moves

How do I design the code better to incorporate adding rules such as checking for
checkmate without doing shotgun surgery?
