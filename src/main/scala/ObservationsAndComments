TODO:
1. If a player wants to move, make sure that the move doesn't put them in check
2. Add typesafety to the board class
3. Had a bug where I mixed up player info based on color--use type safety to fix it
4. Pull out gameplay stuff
5. Fix pawns because can move twice sometimes
6. Handle all these conditionals for color!!! especially turn
7. Pawn promotion to any piece


For Checkmate: (how to break down this problem into smaller ones since
there are lots of ways of causing check)
-get the pieces or pieces that put the king in check
-If the king can't move out of all their way or any other's way and none of the king's color
pieces can eat them then we are in checkmate.

In other words, if the king's pieces can't eat any of the opponent pieces or block their path..
..need to think through checkmate

The last piece that moved does not mean it is the piece that put it in check



How do you structure the code to prevent shotgun surgery?

How do you structure the code to allow plugins? E.g. track the number of pieces
or replay certain moves

How do I design the code better to incorporate adding rules such as checking for
checkmate without doing shotgun surgery?
